EXAMPLE NAME: MODBUS_RTU_MODE_XMC47

EXAMPLE REVISION HISTORY:
V1.0.0 initial version 
V1.1.0 Fix SlaveID response

OVERVIEW: 
XMC4700/XMC4800 USB demo based on DAVE APPs (DAVE v4).
This example demonstrates the implementation of a serial RTU and ASCII Modbusï¿½ client. 
It is based on DAVE APPs (DAVE v4) and the FreeMODBUS implementation which is ported
to XMC4000 family and provided within this example.

DESCRIPTION:

HINTS HOW TO MIGRATE EXAMPLE TO OTHER DEVICES:
Create a new DAVE(TM) project for your device as described inside 
"Getting Started - XMC4700_Relax_MODBUS_serial_RTU_Example.pptx"
chapter "Implementing the application"
The only thing that needs that is device specific and needs to be considered is the pin assignment of the UART pins.
